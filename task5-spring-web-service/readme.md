From Teams:
The time has come for you to start your next homework.
I think many of you will find it the most interesting and engaging of homework so far!
The idea behind it is to build an application from start to finish using all the technologies learned up until this point.
This application is a basic Employee Database Application which will make use of 2 entities: Employee and Department and provide mechanisms to query and modify data within their respective tables.
Please refer to the confluence page under Web App (New) assignment.

For this homework please use Spring Boot and Spring Data.

Deadline: Tuesday, April 26th.
